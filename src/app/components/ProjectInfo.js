      <h2>About My Project</h2>
      <p>
        For my final project, we plan to build a strong Course planner and Degree Tracker.
        The goal is to help students organize their classes by each semester and monitor degree progress
        and make sure they meet graduation requirements. This project will showcase how Next.js and React
        can be used to create an interactive interface that integrates both frontend and backend logic
        for managing academic plans.
